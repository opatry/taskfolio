# Taskfolio

[**Taskfolio**](https://opatry.github.io/taskfolio) is an Android task management app built using [Google Tasks API](https://developers.google.com/tasks/reference/rest). Developed to demonstrate my expertise in modern Android development, it highlights my skills in architecture, UI design with Jetpack Compose, OAuth authentication, and more‚Äîall packaged in a sleek, user-friendly interface.

> I set out to revisit the classical TODO app, ‚Äòlocal-first‚Äô syncing with Google Tasks‚Äîaiming for an <abbr title="Minimum Viable Experience">MVE</abbr> in 2 weeks, focusing on the 80/20 rule to nail the essentials.

## üéØ Project intentions

- [x] Showcase my expertise in Android application development
- [x] Demonstrate UI development using Jetpack Compose with Material Design 3.
- [x] Include local-first capabilities for local data storage using Room.
- [x] OAuth 2.0 authentication.
- [x] Provide sync capabilities with Google Tasks for seamless task management.
- [x] Illustrate my ability to set up CI/CD pipelines and publish apps to the Play Store.

## ‚ùå Out of scope

This project is not intended as a comprehensive task manager for public use.
I do not aim to implement advanced features beyond what is supported by the Google Tasks REST API.
- no starred task
- no task priority
- only due date, no custom time support
- no task recurrence
- limited hierarchy (2 levels)

## üöß Known Limitations

- Authentication flow isn't 100% reliable yet.
- Local-first support with Google Tasks sync is limited, in particular sorting & conflict management is barely implemented.
- No drag'n'drop to re-order tasks nor move them between lists.
- Task list ordering isn't supported (there is no API for that in the Google Tasks API)

## üßë‚Äçüíª Local development

<details>
<summary>See details‚Ä¶</summary>
Decrypt `*.gpg` files needed for development, and copy decrypted versions in proper places.

```bash
PLAYSTORE_SECRET_PASSPHRASE=MY_SECRET ./_ci/decrypt_secrets.sh
```

### Updating `google-services.json`

The production `google-services.json` file is ignored by SCM to avoid exposing API keys in public repository.
To update it, download the new version, encrypt it using `gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 google-services.json` 
and store this in `_ci/google-services.json.gpg`.
The `decrypt_secrets.sh` will take it into account.

### Compose hot reload üî•

<details>
<summary>See details‚Ä¶</summary>
It is possible to use [Compose hot reload](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-hot-reload) on
desktop app by running the `:tasks-app-desktop:runHot` Gradle task.

You'll see a Compose icon near the top left corner of the window.

When clicking on it, it will open a new window with the hot reload status.
