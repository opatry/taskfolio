<summary>üìä Note about coverage‚Ä¶</summary>

The coverage report excludes code not intended to be covered.

This avoids the [‚Äúbroken window‚Äù effect](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-broken-window-theory/): whether coverage is at 43% or 56%, it‚Äôs perceived as equally low‚Äîso efforts to improve it are often dismissed. In contrast, high or near-100% coverage is seen as achievable and worth tracking.

Refer to the root project's [`build.gradle.kts`](build.gradle.kts#L55-L90) for details.

*Excluded elements include:*
- Data models (no logic to test)
- Authentication (tedious to cover for now; may change later)
- Network status check (done for desktop, tedious for Android)
- Dependency injection (limited relevance despite some graph tests)
- Generated code that's untestable or irrelevant (that said, `*Dao_Impl` are retained)
- Root screens (difficult to test due to navigation, `ViewModel`, DI, etc.); testable parts are extracted for UI tests
- Compose UI previews
- Dummy screens using only Material components without logic
- Compose icons
- Resources

# Taskfolio

[**Taskfolio**](https://opatry.github.io/taskfolio) is an Android task management app built using [Google Tasks API](https://developers.google.com/tasks/reference/rest). Developed to demonstrate my expertise in modern Android development, it highlights my skills in architecture, UI design with Jetpack Compose, OAuth authentication, and more‚Äîall packaged in a sleek, user-friendly interface.

> I set out to revisit the classical TODO app, ‚Äòlocal-first‚Äô syncing with Google Tasks‚Äîaiming for an <abbr title="Minimum Viable Experience">MVE</abbr> in 2 weeks, focusing on the 80/20 rule to nail the essentials.

[![Taskfolio on Play Store](assets/GetItOnGooglePlay_Badge_Web_color_English.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.opatry.tasks.app)

## üéØ Project intentions

- [x] Showcase my expertise in Android application development
- [x] Demonstrate UI development using Jetpack Compose with Material Design 3.
- [x] Include local-first capabilities for local data storage using Room.
- [x] OAuth 2.0 authentication.
- [x] Provide sync capabilities with Google Tasks for seamless task management.
- [x] Illustrate my ability to set up CI/CD pipelines and publish apps to the Play Store.

## ‚ùå Out of scope

This project is not intended as a comprehensive task manager for public use.
I do not aim to implement advanced features beyond what is supported by the Google Tasks REST API.

- no task list reordering
- no starred task
- no task priority
- only due date, no custom time support
- no task recurrence
- limited hierarchy (2 levels)

## üöß Known Limitations

- Authentication flow isn't 100% reliable yet ([#34](https://github.com/opatry/taskfolio/issues/34)).
- Local-first support with Google Tasks sync is limited, in particular sorting & conflict management is barely implemented ([#140](https://github.com/opatry/taskfolio/issues/140)).
- No indentation support (ongoing) ([#129](https://github.com/opatry/taskfolio/issues/129))
- Task completion state toggle doesn't honor indentation properly (ongoing) ([#175](https://github.com/opatry/taskfolio/issues/175))
- No drag'n'drop to re-order tasks nor move them between lists ([#133](https://github.com/opatry/taskfolio/issues/133)).
- Task deletion undo is not implemented ([#149](https://github.com/opatry/taskfolio/issues/149)).
- Local action sync failure might not be synced again ([#150](https://github.com/opatry/taskfolio/issues/150)).
- Setting due date is partially supported ([#155](https://github.com/opatry/taskfolio/issues/155)).

## üßë‚Äçüíª Local development

<details>
<summary>See details‚Ä¶</summary>

Decrypt `*.gpg` files needed for development, and copy decrypted versions in proper places.

```bash
PLAYSTORE_SECRET_PASSPHRASE=MY_SECRET ./_ci/decrypt_secrets.sh
```

### Updating `google-services.json`

The production `google-services.json` file is ignored by SCM to avoid exposing API keys in public repository.
To update it, download the new version, encrypt it using `gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 google-services.json` 
and store this in `_ci/google-services.json.gpg`.
The `decrypt_secrets.sh` will take it into account.
</details>

### Compose hot reload üî•

<details>
<summary>See details‚Ä¶</summary>

It is possible to use [Compose hot reload](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-hot-reload) on
desktop app by running the `:tasks-app-desktop:runHot` Gradle task.

You'll see a Compose icon near the top left corner of the window.

![](assets/compose-hot-reload-icon.png)

When clicking on it, it will open a new window with the hot reload status.
