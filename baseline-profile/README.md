Android 14+ to prevent uninstall of the app at first iteration (need an authenticated user for representative usage)
Sign-in to an account with data (hard/impossible to automate, simulate with local data won't leverage ktor in profile)
  Ideally, using the taskfolio.app@gmail.com account
When to update? Somehow find a semi automated way to do it?
